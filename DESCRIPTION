Title: Sensitivity analysis for the interactive effects of internal bias and
  publication bias in meta-analyses
Description: Meta-analyses can be compromised by studies' internal biases (e.g.,
  confounding in nonrandomized studies) as well as publication bias. This
  package conducts sensitivity analyses for the joint effects of these biases
  [see Mathur MB (2022). "Sensitivity analysis for the interactive effects of
  internal bias and publication bias in meta-analyses."
  <doi:10.31219/osf.io/u7vcb>.] These sensitivity analyses address two
  questions: (1) "For a given severity of internal bias across studies and of
  publication bias, how much could the results change?"; and (2) "For a given
  severity of publication bias, how severe would internal bias have to be,
  hypothetically, to attenuate the results to the null or by a given amount?"
