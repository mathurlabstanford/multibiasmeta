Description: Meta-analyses can be compromised by studies' internal biases (e.g., confounding in nonrandomized studies) as well as publication bias. 
Per Mathur 2022 (<https://osf.io/u7vcb/>), this package conducts sensitivity analyses that address two questions: (1) "For a given severity of internal bias across studies and of publication
bias, how much could the results change?""; and (2) "For a given severity of publication bias, how severe would internal bias have to be, hypothetically,
to attenuate the results to the null or by a given amount?"
